  refers to a defeatist lifestyle in China, where people STOP WORKING, desiring material acquisition, and tap out of any social life â€“ sometimes for good. By lying down, young people are participating in a kind of non-cooperation movement, rather than surrendering themselves to China's oppressive work culture where they see little hope of social mobility.
